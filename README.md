# DAT602
The purpose of this repo is to present my work regarding the assignment one rubrik for DAT602. The goal is to hold my files so that they can be used to compile my assignment for my teacher to review and mark.

The content in this repository is two sql files one containing the user requirements like logging in and registering users. the other handled creating a procedue which creates all the tables needed for my game. there is also insert statements for each table beneath the procedure. 
There is a zip file that contains my C# folder that was on my pc for this assignment, it contains a framework for a new game i am developing in which a player can go around a grid and gather items and attack monsters along with other players.


All my written assignment is in the word document in the github files.


1. for the graphical designs of my game i have implemented images of each requirement and a description of those images of what is haopopening in each storyboard.
2. I have done a ERD in which i have shown the tables and their relationships according to how i think the game will function.
3. I have made a CRUD table that represents all of the required tasks of this which meet either Create, read, update, or delete.
4. I have developed SQL produres that create the tables and their relationships in sql. after the procedure i have insert statements to test the relation between them using test-data.
5. I have made a C# application and linked it to this repo, however there seems to be an error when i seem to push it to this repo so i have just zipped it and added it in the files. it has three important screens that are all linked. I have threee data access objects that all represent different things, the game access represents when a new game is opened, a admin one is when you log in (default admin for now), and the user one is when the user logs out(login+registration).
